                      <li>Dipers are only distant related to napkins</li>
                      <li> Our dipers and pads vary in color to include white,blue,pink and purple</li>
                      <li> Is a misconception that dipers are same as napkins;
                      the truth is they are never the same since dipers offers 
                      alot of comfort and can last for good number of hours.</li>
